# MapGenerator
My work in progress for my senior project

The purpose of the project is to be able to generate random maps based on tiles provided to the program. The tiles being used were created by Pipoya and can be downloaded
for free from their site at https://pipoya.itch.io/

The initial push has the ability to display images and the full outline for how the blocks (consisting of the tiles from pipoya's spritesheet) are meant to connect, 
rotate, and be placed.
